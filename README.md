### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'll be updating this repo as much as I can
Hi! Iâ€™m Pedro Marcano, Iâ€™m a computer science and overall technology follower. I create solutions for users that help simplify everyday tasks. I worked creating FileMaker Pro applications for diverse industries helping them reduce time and money doing routine work and getting them to work on things that really matter to them. Working side by side with customers and users to design and create their desired software application from UI elements, give them a UX theyâ€™ll love, to results and reports they will trust. Now Iâ€™m moving to more widespread and open languages to help more and learn from a bigger community.
